# HTTP API

**DEPRECATED DOCS**, see https://api.wildduck.email

WildDuck Mail Server is a scalable IMAP / POP3 server that natively exposes internal data through an HTTP API.

This API is not meant to be used by end users but your application.

## API Usage Info

### Authentication

This API should be used by your application and not by the end users directly, so normally it should probably be hidden behind a firewall.

To add another layer of protection the API can be set to require an access token. The token value can be set in configuration file "api.accessToken". If the
value is set, then all requests against the API must include a query argument _accessToken_ with the same value as in the configuration file.

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users?query=testuser01&accessToken=secrettoken"
```

### Responses

All successful responses look like the following:

```
{
  "success": true,
  other response specific fields
}
```

All failed responses look like the following:

```json
{
    "error": "Some error message"
}
```

### Paging

For paging lists longer than allowed limit, WildDuck API returns cursors for `next` and `previous` pages.

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "total": 200,
    "page": 2,
    "results": ["a list of results"],
    "previousCursor": "abcdef12344",
    "nextCursor": "abcdef12377"
}
```

The `page` property in return value is a "soft" argument, you need to set it yourself with the query argument. WildDuck does not know from which page the
request was made to but your application does. `limit` argument limits the output size (in most cases can not be set higher than 250).

Fetch next page using cursors:

    GET /users/{user}/mailboxes/{mailbox}/messages?next={nextCursor}&page={page+1}&limit=20

Fetch previous page using cursors:

    GET /users/{user}/mailboxes/{mailbox}/messages?previous={previousCursor}&page={page-1}&limit=20

## Users

    },
    "tags": ["green", "blue"],

Recipient/forward limits assume that messages are sent using ZoneMTA with [zonemta-wildduck](https://github.com/wildduck-email/zonemta-wildduck) plugin,
otherwise the counters are not updated or checked.

### Add a new user

#### POST /users

Creates a new user, returns the ID upon success.

**Parameters**

*   **username** (required) is the username of the user. This is not an email address but authentication username, use only letters and numbers
*   **password** (required) is the password for the user. You can use `false` to create an account without a password
*   **address** is the main email address for the user. If address is not set then a new one is generated based on the username and current domain name
*   **emptyAddress** if true, then do not set up an address for the user
*   **name** is the name for the user
*   **quota** is the maximum storage in bytes allowed for this user. If not set then the default value is used
*   **retention** is the default retention time in ms for mailboxes. Messages in Trash and Junk folders have a capped retention time of 30 days.
*   **language** is the language code for the user, eg. "en" or "et". Mailbox names for the default mailboxes (eg. "Trash") depend on the language
*   **recipients** is the maximum number of recipients allowed to send mail to in a 24h window. Requires ZoneMTA with the WildDuck plugin
*   **forwards** is the maximum number of forwarded emails in a 24h window. Requires ZoneMTA with the WildDuck plugin

*   **encryptForwarded** (boolean) indicates if forwarded messages stored be encrypted using the PGP key. Encryption applies after filter rules
*   **sess** an optional string of user session to be stored in security log
*   **ip** is the IP address the request was made from

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "secretpass",
  "address": "testuser@example.com",
  "ip": "192.168.10.10"

```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
    "success": true,

        }
    ]
}
```

Log entries expire after 30 days.

## 2FA

WildDuck supports TOTP and U2f based 2FA. If 2FA is enabled then users are requested to enter authentication token after successful login. Also, with 2FA
enabled, master password can not be used in IMAP, POP3 or SMTP. The user must create an [Application Specific Password](#application-specific-passwords) with a
correct scope for email clients using these protocols.

2FA checks do not happen magically, your application must be 2FA aware:

1.  Authenticate user with the [/authenticate](#authenticate-a-user) call
2.  If authentication result includes `requirePasswordChange:true` then force user to change their password
3.  If authentication result includes `require2fa:false` then do nothing, the user is now authenticated. Otherwise continue with Step 4. or Step 5.
4.  If `require2fa` array includes 'totp' then:
5.  Request TOTP token from the user before allowing to perform other actions
6.  Check the token with _/user/{user}/2fa/totp/check_
7.  If token verification succeeds then user is authenticated
8.  If `require2fa` array includes 'u2f' then:
9.  Authentication response should include u2fAuthRequest object. If it is missing or verification times out then you can fetch a new U2F request object from the
    server with _/user/{user}/2fa/u2f/start_
10. Send authentication request to U2F key
11. Send authentication response from key to server with _/user/{user}/2fa/totp/check_
12. If token verification succeeds then user is authenticated

### Setup 2FA

#### POST /users/{user}/2fa/totp/setup

This call prepares the user to support 2FA tokens. If 2FA is already enabled then this call fails.

**Parameters**

*   **user** (required) is the ID of the user
*   **issuer** is the name to be shown in the Authenticator App
*   **fresh** is a boolean. If true then generates a new seed even if an old one already exists
*   **sess** an optional string of user session to be stored in security log
*   **ip** is the IP address the request was made from

**Response fields**

*   **success** should be `true`
*   **qrcode** is the data url for the 2FA QR-code. The user must scan the code and return the token with a PUT call

**Example**

```

```javascript
res.set('Content-Description', 'Mail App Configuration Profile');
res.set('Content-Type', 'application/x-apple-aspen-config');

**Parameters**

*   **user** (required) is the ID of the user
*   **message** (required) is the ID of the message
*   **mailbox** is an optional ID of the destination mailbox. By default the message is restored to the mailbox it was deleted from or to INBOX if the source
    mailbox does not exist anymore

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/59467f27535f8f0f067ba8e6/archived/5a0d7baa221311cf2d8f145e/restore" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

Response for a successful operation includes the mailbox ID the message was restored to and the updated UID of the message:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "mailbox": "5a05ad49484b251f07951b22",
    "uid": 40
}
```

## Quota

### Recalculate user quota

#### POST /users/{user}/quota/reset

Recalculates used storage for a user. Use this when it seems that quota counters for a user do not match with reality.

**Parameters**

*   **user** (required) is the ID of the user

**Example**

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/users/59467f27535f8f0f067ba8e6/quota/reset" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

Response for a successful operation:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "storageUsed": 128
}
```

Be aware though that this method is not atomic and should be done only if quota counters are way off.

## Updates

Get user related events as an Event Source stream

### Stream update events

#### GET /users/{user}/updates

Streams changes in user account as EventSource stream

**Parameters**

*   **user** (required) is the ID of the user

**Example**

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/users/59467f27535f8f0f067ba8e6/updates"
```

Response stream:

```
data: {"command":"EXISTS", "message":"596e0703f0bdd512aeac3600", "mailbox":"596c9c37ef2213165daadc65",...}
id: 596e0703f0bdd512aeac3605

data: {"command":"CREATE","mailbox":"596e09853f845a14f3620b5c","name":"My Mail",...}
id: 596e09853f845a14f3620b5d
```

First entry in the event stream indicates that a message with id `596e0703f0bdd512aeac3600` was added to mailbox `596c9c37ef2213165daadc65`, second entry
indicates that a new mailbox called _"My Mail"_ with id `596e09853f845a14f3620b5c` was created.

Be aware though that this connection needs to be properly closed if you do not want to end up with memory leaks.
